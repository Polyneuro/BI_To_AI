    "Previous development of D-M model for polygenic inheritance produced a model (see Binomial Genomics) that can account for independent gene configurations. But this did not account for interactions between genes and gene-environment interactions. It was proposed a hierarchical tree model (Bayesian or HMM) would be required to generate a complete model. Here we consider that an alternative to the conventional hierarchical graph systems could be explored by a deeper understanding of how biological neural networks function. Drawing on this understanding we develop fundamental principles for a new machine learning paradigm from the ground up. This would involve significant change in thinking from basic (Boolean) logic of computer science and machine learning to incorporating neuromorphic features in affordable large scale integrated circuits such as FPGAs. This will be in line with the basic principles and algorithms developed in this set of experiments."

    "The aim is to find strategies for using discrete, binarized recurrent networks, such that D-M distribution replaces Bayesian networks and bit-wise recurrent processes replace HM like methods. By simplifying the process in this way, it is hoped to build a framework that is congruent with biology and could reduce costs and improve efficiency. The realization of the Dirichlet (Alpha)-Multinomial algorithm was achieved deductively based on the basic assumptions of Mendelian inheritance and Hardy-Weinberg equation. Increasing generalizations were derived to obtain the final model using Dirichlet (alpha) multinomial distribution for estimating polygenic gene configurations. "
