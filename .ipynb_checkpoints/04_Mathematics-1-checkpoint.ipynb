    "While it is generally accepted that the SN switches between DMN and CEN, the fact that the DMN has both excitatory and inhibitory connections to the SN, indicate that it performs the switching function (it is fitting that this function would be mediated by the mPFC). When DMN is normally active, it is likley to inhibit both SN and CEN, thus reducing the recurrent excitation between these networks. However, when any new information is received from the SN, requiring attention, this could be postultaed to switch DMN to exitatory inputs to the SN. This would then reduce the inhibitory tone that faciltates the recurrent excitation circuit between CEN and SN. This is essentially a sensory-motor circuit that attends to stimuli (interoceptive and exteroceptive) and make decisions about motor actions on the environment. The DMN with its capacity to engage in embodied and abstract self navigating both phsycial and social environment, would then be in a position to provide potential simulation of actions. These recurrent activities would be equivalent to rotations in abstract emotional space. In the primitive vertebrate brain it wouldhave been the erly version of the insula and pallium (lateral-spatial, medial-emotional) that would have cordinated with the hippocampus and amygdala. Again, the more recent frontal structures add to and overlay these circuits. Overall these connctions can be seen to serve the function of creating a self-other boundary necessary for motivated action and become more abstract with evolution."

    "**Primary vs Secondary (Social Emotions)**\n",
    "As indicated previously, primitive sense of self-boundary functions emerge very early in evolution of multi-cellular organisms and the structures involved can be phylogenetically followed from the lower brainstem all the way to emergence of Telencephalon and the cignulate gyrus in mammals.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The primitive emotions in fish can be considered largely retricted to **figh-or flight** reactions and **vigilance**. The structures equivalent to amygdala and hippocampus, providing the **emotional** reactions and the **spatial** context beigin to emerge and covers the forebrain. It may be assumed that forerunners of emotions such as **joy** and **sadness** may involve feeding and resting when food is not available. The emotional circuit involves mainly connection to the effector circuit via the hypothalamus and input from the PAG. The differentiation between aggression and sexual activity may not be highly developed. Later, land animals develop the striatum, necessary for assuming posture against gravity. With the emergence of the ventral striatum, amygdala-ventral striatum connection result in **avoidance**, **approach** behaviour. In these lower regions, states such as **anger-fear**, **joy-sadness** may assume a more recognisable form by humans. This becomes more evident when mammals emerge with the **cingulate gyrus**, facilitating social emotions and navigation. It is of interest that structures such as the **insula**, lies on the outside of the cortex in mammals such as mouse and rat (inner aspects of the lateral sulcus or **Sylvian fissure**). Emergence of this structure may have facilitated the more explicit experience of disgust (surprise and disgust being opposite poles of reactions to an initial stmulus) and surprise. Surprise is essentially a primitive emotion associated with early attention for potential threat. In mammals, with the advnt of the higher cortical structures all the primitive feelings become more nuanced (e.g. surprise-disgust axis would be influenced by interest or aversion to new relationships, as well as food or other stimuli) and can be recognises as **primary emotions**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is postulatd here that, with mammalian evolution, the central emotional circuits (amygdala, ventral striatum and spatial context from hippocampus) have **modulatory activity** both from the **higher centers** (frontal systems including the cingulate) and continued stimulation from **lower centres** such as the Periaquiductal Grey (**PAG**) and the mono-aminergic projections from the RAS to both the ventral striatum and hypothalamus. This dual modulation of the function of the central limbic structures probably produce the primary emotions we can recognise in mammmals such as humans via recurrent circuits.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given their early association with landmarks and spatial context, emotions could be recognised as emerging as **abstract landmarks** when navigating physical space and later social space. Here we generate a model of emotions as landmarks in a **physical** as well as **social** landscape permitting rapid decisions including **simulation** before action. Further, we use **antipodal relations** between emotions. It is proposed that this permits smooth and if necessary rapid transitions in emotional stance whether one is far or close to home, or among close humans or strangers. The figure below displays the likley evoution of realtion to space, thus navigation became associated with emotions."

    "In the first figure, representing the antipodal relation between two primary emotions that are complementary,the complex plane is control and safety. The safety axis is projected into the page. As one moves away from home (South Pole), there is a boundary (territory) beyond which it beocmes less safe and the feeling switches from potential anger (fight) to potential fear (flight). Such feelings may also be modulated by the sense of control. Thus there is a continous change of both feeling state and associated motor plan and action depending on the environmental and internal cues.\n",

    "**Pride-Embarassment**\n",
    "In the second figure we depict social emotions associated with social space. The complex axes are that of affiliation and power. If one is higher in the hierarchy of the local (affiliated) group, then there is a sense of pride. If one is outside the safety zone of the affliated group, there may be embarassment, especially if one's achievements are not recognised by distant authority figures. However, in th presence of affliates, one may gather one's pride and confidence to deal with strangers. Again, social navigation is complex but feedback circuits and adjustment of input output chracteristics may prvide rapid adjustment of emotions. Given that circuits for secondary emotions are evolutionary overlaid on the circuits involved in primary emotions, any disruption to function of higher circuits may result in emergence of habit-related (as opposed to socially learnt) behaviour patterns. Such patterns if extablished, are considered mental ill-health in humans."

    "On this chapter we have constructed ideas about **antipodality** using **GA** and **Riemann sphere** rotations (**Möbius Transformations**) and linked them to **land marks**, **navigation** and **emotions**. It is demonstrated that in addition to recurrent circuits between **cortical modules** that result in **mental rotations**, recurrent circuits between **large networks** may also result in **abstract rotations**, subsuming the circuits involved in physical navigation. Such concepts have been demonstrated to be mathematically equivalent to Riemann sphere rotaions and complex plane rotations. In the next chapter the concept of antipodality will be proved more rigorously, prior to considering **logical planes** and their **recursion** as a model for how the nodes of a neural tree engage in recurrent feedback. In the case of recurrence between brain networks, we also demonstrate that hierarchcial organisation of these recurrent relations could aquire a simialr structure to how the other nueral networks (including a single neuron) operates. Such structure can then be considered similar to how we derived the **Dirichlet (alpha) Multinomial distribution** to represent hypotehtical polygenic interaction (see **Binomial Genomics repository**). However, the D-M or alpha-multinomial distribution results in independent probabilities for gene clusters. It does not take account of **gene-gene** and **gene-environment** interactions. We had previously proposed that a **hierarchical graph** model using **Markov processes** could b a solution for this. Here we propose that the recurrent logical processes (**edges**) and alpha-multinomial distribution per level (**node probablities**) would be a solution not only for a **comprehensive genomics algorithm** but extends all the way from **membrane dynamics**, through **single neuron** function and interaction btween **cortical modules** to **large scale networks**, resulting in **Social navigation**. Given that **systems theory** uses **feedback processes** and **homeostasis** as its fundamental model, then **family and social systems** could easily be incorporated with this algorithms as well.\n",

It may also represent the adjustment that optimizes B which will affect the rotation in the azimuth angle. A recursion between 𝜙 and 𝜃 could represent iteration of rotation between cardinal poles (N-S, E-W). If the two angles are coupled, it will affect the magnitude of B (range of interest in data).
